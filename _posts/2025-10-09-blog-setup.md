title: Blog setup
---

This is my first real post. Sort of. I'm not gonna write much. But merely want to test whether this really works, and just say how much I like the template. ChatGPT created it for me based on the default layout of `bearblog.dev` (which I really like but don't use because it doesn't integrate with local markdown files, which is a must-have for me).

So, here I am. With a simple setup that allows me to write in Obsidian and use Github pages to publish for free. For now, I deliberately don't want these posts to go to my personal Github page to keep the writing hidden (not that I expect there to be much traffic to my personal Github...).

The setup for this blog is super simple. You can see all files in [this](https://github.com/fabiangunzinger/reveal) repo. Locally, I then simply open the repo directory as a vault in Obsidian.

I'm really happy with this. Setting this up with ChatGPT took about one hour simply because I misnamed a couple files and because I didn't replace a placeholder value for a long time that Chat forgot to point me to. But after that hour, I got exactly what I wanted. The initial prompt was something like

```
I want to set up a blog using Github (project) pages in 5 minutes. Provide a step-by-step guide. I want the theme to be as close as possible to the default of bearblog (i.e. minimalist, plain).
```
And Chat delivered.
