title: What if this were easy
---
I just want to test whether writing another post is really this easy. I just created a template, and now I'm just writing something to see whether it will get published after I push this. I think it will.

I should be in bed by now. The goal was to be 10 minutes ago. And I still have to shower and get ready and – of course – turn the macbook off and start the process. At this point, 10:30 pm would be decent.

So, I'm gonna post this in a moment.

M and I were talking about life priorities over lunch today as we are trying to weigh competing priorities – moving to Switzerland asap, having another child, living in an area with likeminded people (at least some of the them), finding fulfilling work for both of us, and finding the kind of house we've started dreaming of in summer. The main insight for me was that we need to focus on the big things. The absolute priorities. The things that will still matter at the end of our live. The things, in other words, we'll measure our lives by: how many children would we like? do we prioritise proximity to an international urban center (i.e. Zurich) over having a big (old farm) house with lots of space? There are others. I'm not even sure the one about Zurich and the house belong here. The one about children surely does. The point is we have to identify what these big questions are, make decisions that get us onto the path towards them, and then deal with whatever comes up in the short-term as they come up. Just do our best. Day to day, month to month, year to year. All while making sure that we're making progress towards the important stuff.
