title: A moment of clarity
---
Folding blankets, thinking about how much harder moments like this morning would be with two kids, leaving alone three.

But then I thought of Anna and Thomas (who are about to have a third child), Guelph, and the fact that 20 years hence, there would be three grown adults and we'd be a big family. How nice would could be. By then, my working life would largely be over, and other things would matter more.

By extension, just how important is all that working and striving now? That was the moment where for an instance â€“ it was like the fog of ambition and pushing and rushing and status-seeking lifted for a tiny moment and revealed the place where the truly valuable things are. My family and the time I spend with them is what I saw. Other things I could not make out. But I could see they were there.
