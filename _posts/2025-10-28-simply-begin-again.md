title: Simply begin again
---
Simply begin again. It's the mantra that Joseph Goldstein talks about in the short guided meditation I sometimes follow in the morning these days. The idea is simple: when you notice that you got lost in a train of thoughts during your meditation, you appreciate the moment of clarity that allowed you to realise what happened, and then simply begin refocusing on the object of your meditation. Joseph calls the words "the most important three words in mindfulness meditation". 

They may also be the three most important words in life. They certainly are for me. Any effort I've managed to sustain over the years – physical exercise, meditation, practicing splits, moderate eating – has been a long series of periods of uninterrupted practice that, invariably, got interrupted for more or less long by the vagaries of life. I've managed to sustain them not because the daily chain of practice never got interrupted, but after such interruptions of various length I've started again, and again, and again.

I wonder whether the same is true in my professional life. There's the saying that success comes to those who don't quit. That's surely true. The more difficult question, though, it when it is the right thing to quit. Because just as you won't get anywhere by quitting immediately all the time you won't get anywhere – or at least not to a happy place – by forcing yourself to do things you don't want to do, forever.

What's the balance? I might have a choice to make about a career move. I can decide to keep my present role and stay in the city we are but don't want to be or take a new role in the town we want to move to. The catch is that – in some ways, perhaps even many ways – the new role is a step away from the direction I want to develop professionally and, more importantly, might well demand that I keep immerse myself in the kind of work I've forced myself to do for years now.

I love aspects of that work, but my current role has given me the opportunity to realise that there are other aspects of the work I enjoy more. The details are something for another post, as I keep thinking about what the right choice is here.
